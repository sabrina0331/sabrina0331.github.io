                we have the luxury of ulimited access to fresh seafood, fresh homegrown produce, and farm grown meats. Washington
                being a 'Green' state, you can always expect quality ingredients. You can find anything from Carribean food, to East African food. Seattle has been greatly influcenced by Asian
                culture, as you walk the streets it can be overwelling. especially if you find yourself in the middle of Chinatown. Here is some links that could help you navigate through the overwelming amount of resturants. </p>
